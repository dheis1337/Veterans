### Overview
This is repository dedicated to a project I worked on for the Office of Veterans 
Affairs at my CU Denver during my undergraduate studies. The director of the office
wanted to develop some reports on their students, so I worked in a consulting
role during my last semester in college to develop these reports for him. 
Due to student privacy rights I can't share any of the data with you. Here's a 
quick overview of what's in this repository:

#### Cleaning.R
This is a script dedicated to cleaning the data I received. 


#### GradRatesAnalysis.R
This is a script dedicated to doing some analysis on the graduation rates of the
students. 

#### SummaryCharts.R
This is a script dedicated to creating some visualizations on the analysis I conducted.
